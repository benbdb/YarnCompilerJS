# YarnCompilerJS

YarnCompilerJS is an unofficial Yarn Script Project Compiler developed in NodeJS. The project currently compiles to an AST (Abstract Syntx Tree). The next phase, which is in active development, will invole serializing the AST based on the [YarnSpinner proto](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/main/YarnSpinner/yarn_spinner.proto).
